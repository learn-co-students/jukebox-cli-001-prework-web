Introduce CLI, or Command Line Interface, programs.\n2. Running CLI applications.\n3. Use `gets` for user input.\n4. Introduce stubbing in tests.\n5. Integrate procedural Ruby basics to create a simple CLI Jukebox. \n6. Advanced: play music from a Ruby program!\n\n## What is a CLI?\n\nA CLI, or command line interface, allows a user to interface, or interact with, a computer's operating system or a particular application. You've already become comfortable interacting with the command line to navigate files, connect with Github and test your programs. In a command line application, the user will respond to a prompt that your program will output to the terminal. The user's response, or input, will be received by the application and the application will then carry out the programmed response based on that input. \n\nFor example, I might have a command line application which, once run, will ask the user for their location and in return ouput the current weather for that location to the terminal.\n\n## Running Command Line Apps\n\nIn order to run our program from the command line and allow our user to interact with our program as described above, we need to set up a few things.\n\nFirst, your program needs a `bin` directory. \"Bin\" is short for \"binary\" and is just another way to refer to executable files. Accordingly, your executable files belong in this directory. \n\n**Executable files** are any files that contain instructions in a form that a computer's operating system or application can understand and follow. Any executable files we place in our bin directory need to begin with the following line: \n\n`#!\/usr\/bin\/env ruby`\n\nThis is often referred to as a \"shebang line\" and it tells the shell which interpreter to use to execute the remainder of the file. \n\nUsing the above setup, you can run your program by typing `ruby bin\/\u003c your file name \u003e` into the command line. \n\nAlternatively, you can execute your program by simply typing `bin\/\u003c your file name \u003e` into the command line, since the shebang line at the top of your executable file is already telling the shell to use Ruby to interpret the rest of the file. \n\n## Overview\n\nYou're going to write a jukebox that introduces itself to the user and then asks for the user's input on the command line. \n\nThere are a number of ways to accept user input. Today, we'll be building a Jukebox that functions primarily by accepting user input via the command line. \n\nTo demonstrate the example of user input via the command line, let's make a small program inside our `jukebox.rb` file. Our program will ask a user for their name, collect the user input via the `gets` command, and then say hello to that user. Let's follow the code block below:\n\n```ruby\ndef say_hello(name)\n  \"Hi #{name}!\"\nend\n\nputs \"Enter your name:\"\nusers_name = gets.chomp\n\nputs say_hello(users_name)\n```\n\nWhen we run `ruby lib\/jukebox.rb`, it's going to print out `Enter your name:`, then the Terminal prompt will return, and you'll type in your name. The user input is obtained by the `gets` method, then any trailing whitespace gets removed via the `chomp` method, and finally the result is stored in the `users_name` local variable (let's assume `users_name = \"Avi Flombaum\"`). Finally, the program will print out the output of the `say_hello` method, which is `\"Hi, Avi Flombaum!\"`.\n\n\nNow, go head and delete or comment out the code we just wrote. That was just for practice (and fun). Let's move on to the Jukebox.\n\n![Jukebox](https:\/\/camo.githubusercontent.com\/fcdfb7f86db18e9a497747c8d6f4283a8a136f76\/687474703a2f2f646c2e64726f70626f7875736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f732f6f7764666a69356c6a71756264686e2f323031342d30312d3239253230617425323031312e3130253230414d2e706e67)\n\nYour jukebox should respond to 4 commands: `help`, `play`, `list`, and `exit`.\n\nWhen you run the program in the command line it should greet the user and prompt them for input. Your jukebox should respond to 4 commands: `help`, `play`, `list`, and `exit`.\n\n1. The help command should output instructions for the user on how to use the jukebox. \n2. The list command should output a list of songs that the user can play. \n3. The play command should ask a user to input a song name or number. It should then output 'Playing Phoenix - 1901' or whatever the song name is.\n4. If the user types in exit, the jukebox should say goodbye and the program should shut down.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the methods we'll need to build in order to get our Jukebox up and running as described here. \n\n## Instructions\n\nWe'll be building a series of methods that enact the desired behavior of our Jukebox. In `lib\/jukebox.rb` we'll create a `help`, `play`, `list` and `exit_jukebox` method. Then, we'll build a `run` method that calls on all of these \"helper\" methods to implement the behavior of our program. The executable file in `bin\/jukebox` file will simply call the `run` method that we define in `lib\/jukebox.rb`. \n\nOpen up `lib\/jukebox.rb` and you should see this:\n\n```ruby\nsongs = [\n  \"Phoenix - 1901\",\n  \"Tokyo Police Club - Wait Up\",\n  \"Sufjan Stevens - Too Much\",\n  \"The Naked and the Famous - Young Blood\",\n  \"(Far From) Home - Tiga\",\n  \"The Cults - Abducted\",\n  \"Phoenix - Consolation Prizes\",\n  \"Harry Chapin - Cats in the Cradle\",\n  \"Amos Lee - Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight\"\n]\n```\n\nThis is the list of songs that our jukebox will be working with. The methods we will write will operate on this arrays of songs. \n\n### The `help` Method\n\nThis method should `puts` out the following: \n\n```bash\nI accept the following commands:\n- help : displays this help message\n- list : displays a list of songs you can play\n- play : lets you choose a song to play\n- exit : exits this program\n```\n\n### The `list` Method\n\nThis method takes in an argument of the `songs` array of `puts` out the following:\n\n```bash\n1. Phoenix - 1901\n2. Tokyo Police Club - Wait Up\n3. Sufjan Stevens - Too Much\n4. The Naked and the Famous - Young Blood\n5. (Far From) Home - Tiga\n6. The Cults - Abducted\n7. Phoenix - Consolation Prizes\n8. Harry Chapin - Cats in the Cradle\n9. Amos Lee - Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight\n```\n\n**Hint:** Use the `Array#each_with_index` method to access the index number of a given element as you step through the iteration. Remember that arrays are indexed starting at `0`. So, adding `1` to the index number at a given step of the iteration will result in the correct song number for the purposes of outputting your list of songs. \n\n### The `play` Method\n\nThis method also takes in an argument of the `songs` array. It first `puts` out the prompt: `\"Please enter a song name or number:\"`. It then stores the user's response using `gets.chomp`. \n\nIf the user's response is a valid song number or song name, the method should `puts` out: `\"Playing \u003csong name\u003e\"`. Otherwise, it should `puts` out: `\"Invalid input, please try again\"`. \n\n### The `exit_jukebox` Method\n\nThis method is simple. It `puts` out: `\"Goodbye\"`.\n\n### The `run` Method\n\nThis method is a little trickier. It will use the other methods we built, our \"helper\" methods, to actually enact the running of our Jukebox. \n\nFirst, this method should call on the `help` method to show the user the available commands. Then, it should `puts` out the prompt: `\"Please enter a command:\"`. It should capture the user's response using `gets.chomp` or `gets.strip`. \n\nWe need to keep our program running as long as the user's input is *not* `\"exit\"`. Use a loop to continue asking the user for input until or unless their input is `\"exit\"`. Use `if` or `case` statements to determine how your program will respond to a user's input. For example, if their input is `\"list\"`, call the `list` method, if their input is `\"play\"`, call the `play` method, if their input is `\"help\"`, call the `help` method and if their input is `\"exit\"`, call the `exit_jukebox` method *and* break out of your loop to stop the program. \n\n## Running Your Jukebox \n\nPackaged with this repository is a runner file `bin\/jukebox`.\n\nThis executable file, `bin\/jukebox`, is a Ruby file, but the \".rb\" extension has been left off. The \".rb\" extension is not mandatory for Ruby files, it is just a nice thing to have for the purposes of identifying the type of the file. However, it is a convention to leave the file extension off of executable files, which comes from true binary files that contain pure\nmachine code (1's and 0's) rather than human readable source code like Ruby.\n\nOpen up `bin\/jukebox` and you will see the following:\n\n```ruby\n#!\/usr\/bin\/env ruby\n\nrequire_relative \"..\/lib\/jukebox\"\n\nsongs = [\n  \"Phoenix - 1901\",\n  \"Tokyo Police Club - Wait Up\",\n  \"Sufjan Stevens - Too Much\",\n  \"The Naked and the Famous - Young Blood\",\n  \"(Far From) Home - Tiga\",\n  \"The Cults - Abducted\",\n  \"Phoenix - Consolation Prizes\",\n  \"Harry Chapin - Cats in the Cradle\",\n  \"Amos Lee - Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight\"\n]\n\nrun(songs)\n```\n\nFirst, we require the `lib` file in which we defined our code. Now this executable file has access to all of the methods we defined in `lib\/jukebox.rb`. Then we have our `songs` array. Then, we call `run(songs)`, the method we defined to enact the behavior of our program.\n\nAssuming you are in the root directory of the jukebox project, run your jukebox from the command line with `ruby bin jukebox` or simply `bin\/jukebox` (thanks to our shebang line).\n\n## Testing Your Jukebox\n\nYou already know that your Jukebox command line application relies on a user's input to run. In order to test our application programmatically\u2013\u2013in other words, test it without having to run and interact with the program ourselves\u2013\u2013we will rely on stubbing in our test suite. \n\n## What is Stubbing?\n\nStubbing refers to the fake implementation of a method. In the context of this test suite, we will stub the `gets` method call that our program relies on to obtain user input and feed it back into the application. In this way, we can simulate the CLI and effectively test our app. \n\nLet's compare the regular running of our Jukebox\u2013\u2013i.e., when a real live human interacts with it\u2013\u2013with the testing of our Jukebox. We'll do this by taking a closer look at the `play` method. \n\nWithout giving away *all* of the implementation of this method and spoiling your fun, we can imagine that our `play` method might ask the user what song they want to hear, store that input using the `gets` method and use it to determine what song to play.  \n\nRemember, the `gets` method lets the user input a line and returns that line to your program. In our test suite, we need to fake this interaction and we'll use stubbing to do it. Check out the following line from our `jukebox_spec.rb`:  \n\n```ruby\nit \"can use a full song name to find a song\" do\n  allow(self).to receive(:gets).and_return(\"Phoenix - 1901\")\n  expect{ play(songs) }.to output(\/Phoenix - 1901\/).to_stdout\nend\n```\n \n      \nLet's break down what's happening above: \n\nWith `allow(self).to receive(:gets).and_return(\"Phoenix - 1901\")`,\nwe are faking a call to the `gets` method and telling it to return a value of `\"Phoenix - 1901\"`. \n\nNow, when we call the `play` method on the following line, it has a `gets` value to operate on. \n\nThen, we test the output of the `play` method with\n `expect{ play(songs) }.to output(\/Phoenix - 1901\/).to_stdout`\n\nThis line uses one of Learn's output matchers. \n\n### Output Matchers \n\nLearn's output matchers provide a way to check that your program has emitted output to `$stdout`\u2013\u2013a global variable that keeps track of the current standard output to your terminal. Don't worry too much about global variables right now, just know that they can be accessed from anywhere in your program. \n\nThe `.to_stdout` method works by temporarily replacing the `$stdout` variable. When the `output` method is used with a string or a regex (as above), your test will pass if the block outputs a string `to_stdout` that matches the given string or regex.\n\nSo, these lines of our test suite:\n\n```ruby\nallow(self).to receive(:gets).and_return(\"Phoenix - 1901\")\nexpect{ play(songs) }.to output(\/Phoenix - 1901\/).to_stdout\n```\n\nAccomplish the following:\n\n1. Establish a `gets` value for the `play` method to utilize\n2. Execute the `play` method contained in the block \n2. Check to see if the `play` method outputs content that matches the regular expression `\/Phoenix - 1901\/`\n\n## Advanced: Playing Music from Ruby\n\nIn `lib\/advanced_jukebox.rb` you'll be building on your jukebox so that it allows the user to play songs from the command line. You'll be playing the songs in `audio\/Emerald-Park`, which contains some mp3 files. \n\n### Setting Up the Songs Hash\n\nIn `lib\/advanced_jukebox.rb` you'll see a `my_songs` hash which has keys of song names and values of the path to of each mp3 file (in `jukebox-cli\/audio\/Emerald-Park\/\u003cfile name\u003e.mp3`). \n\nChange the value of each hash key to reflect the correct file path. For example, if this jukebox-cli directory is in `Users\/\u003cyour name\u003e\/Desktop\/Dev\/`, the value of the first key should be `Users\/\u003cyour name\u003e\/Desktop\/Dev\/jukebox-cli\/audio\/Emerald-Park\/01.mp3`. If you're not sure what the path to the file is, cd into the directory of this lab in your terminal and type `pwd`. This stands for \"print working directory\" and will return the path to your current location. \n\n### How can a Ruby program play music?\n\nIt is possible to play audio files via the command line by simply typing `open \u003cpath to audio file\u003e`. This will launch your computer's audio player (iTunes, for example). In order to tell Ruby to execute a command line command, we use the following syntax: \n\n```ruby\nsystem 'open \u003cpath to audio file'\n```\n\nThis is the code that you'll be adding to your `play` method in order to play the audio files we've provided for you. \n\n### Coding `advanced_jukebox.rb`\n\nCheck out the code in `advanced_jukebox.rb`, we've left the method definitions for you and provided you the song hash, `my_songs`. \n\nFollow the instructions in the comments of `advanced_jukebox.rb` to get your\njukebox working. This is a bonus challenge, so there are no tests. Just get your jukebox playing music. \n\n**Hint:** You can open a file from the command line by typing `open \u003cfilename\u003e` in your terminal. (If you are not using a Mac, the command you type will be a little [different](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/6657777\/open-text-file-and-program-shortcut-in-windows-batch-file). If the file is an audio file, you computer will open the file and play it. We want our Ruby Jukebox program to execute that command for us. Ruby has method, `system`, that is called with an argument of a string that contains the command line command you want to execute. When Ruby invokes that method, the command you placed in the string will be executed. So, to play a song from a Ruby file, you can use `system \"open #{filename}\"`. \n\n**Run your advanced jukebox program by typing `ruby bin\/advanced_jukebox` in your terminal. This is the runner file for the `advanced_jukebox.rb` code.**\n\n\u003cp data-visibility='hidden'\u003eView \u003ca href='https:\/\/learn.co\/lessons\/jukebox-cli' title='Build a Jukebox'\u003eBuild a Jukebox\u003c\/a\u003e on Learn.co and start learning to code for free.\u003c\/p\u003e\n","tracks":[{"id":6330,"title":"Pre-College Advanced Software Engineering"},{"id":4563,"title":"Ironboard Demo"},{"id":11897,"title":"Teacher Training - Web Development Fundamentals"},{"id":2278,"title":"DEPRECATED -Teacher Fellowship Prework"},{"id":225,"title":"After School Advanced Ruby"},{"id":5309,"title":"Web Development with Ruby on Rails"},{"id":1564,"title":"Web Development - Fellowship"},{"id":3273,"title":"Web Development - Ruby"},{"id":8308,"title":"QA Testing 3"},{"id":10415,"title":"Web Development Fundamentals"},{"id":13443,"title":"Web Development Immersive 2016"},{"id":9683,"title":"Web Development with Ruby on Rails - 2015"},{"id":11095,"title":"Learn to Teach Code - Web Development"},{"id":15712,"title":"VfA - Web Development Fundamentals"},{"id":16310,"title":"Web Development Immersive Spring 2016"}],"has_lab":true,"completed_progresses_count":266,"readme_markdown_as_html":"\u003ch2\u003eObjectives\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduce CLI, or Command Line Interface, programs.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRunning CLI applications.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUse \u003ccode\u003egets\u003c\/code\u003e for user input.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntroduce stubbing in tests.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIntegrate procedural Ruby basics to create a simple CLI Jukebox. \u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAdvanced: play music from a Ruby program!\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ol\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is a CLI?\u003c\/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA CLI, or command line interface, allows a user to interface, or interact with, a computer\u0026#39;s operating system or a particular application.

<h2>What is a CLI?</h2>

<p>A CLI, or command line interface, allows a user to interface, or interact with, a computer's operating system or a particular application. You've already become comfortable interacting with the command line to navigate files, connect with Github and test your programs. In a command line application, the user will respond to a prompt that your program will output to the terminal. The user's response, or input, will be received by the application and the application will then carry out the programmed response based on that input. </p>

<p>For example, I might have a command line application which, once run, will ask the user for their location and in return ouput the current weather for that location to the terminal.</p>

<h2>Running Command Line Apps</h2>

<p>In order to run our program from the command line and allow our user to interact with our program as described above, we need to set up a few things.</p>

<p>First, your program needs a <code>bin</code> directory. "Bin" is short for "binary" and is just another way to refer to executable files. Accordingly, your executable files belong in this directory. </p>

<p><strong>Executable files</strong> are any files that contain instructions in a form that a computer's operating system or application can understand and follow. Any executable files we place in our bin directory need to begin with the following line: </p>

<p><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</code></p>

<p>This is often referred to as a "shebang line" and it tells the shell which interpreter to use to execute the remainder of the file. </p>

<p>Using the above setup, you can run your program by typing <code>ruby bin/&lt; your file name &gt;</code> into the command line. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you can execute your program by simply typing <code>bin/&lt; your file name &gt;</code> into the command line, since the shebang line at the top of your executable file is already telling the shell to use Ruby to interpret the rest of the file. </p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You're going to write a jukebox that introduces itself to the user and then asks for the user's input on the command line. </p>

<p>There are a number of ways to accept user input. Today, we'll be building a Jukebox that functions primarily by accepting user input via the command line. </p>

<p>To demonstrate the example of user input via the command line, let's make a small program inside our <code>jukebox.rb</code> file. Our program will ask a user for their name, collect the user input via the <code>gets</code> command, and then say hello to that user. Let's follow the code block below:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">say_hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span></li><li class="L1">  <span class="s2">"Hi </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">!"</span></li><li class="L2"><span class="k">end</span></li><li class="L3">&nbsp;</li><li class="L4"><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Enter your name:"</span></li><li class="L5"><span class="n">users_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">gets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">chomp</span></li><li class="L6">&nbsp;</li><li class="L7"><span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">say_hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">users_name</span><span class="p">)</span></li></ol></code></pre>

<p>When we run <code>ruby lib/jukebox.rb</code>, it's going to print out <code>Enter your name:</code>, then the Terminal prompt will return, and you'll type in your name. The user input is obtained by the <code>gets</code> method, then any trailing whitespace gets removed via the <code>chomp</code> method, and finally the result is stored in the <code>users_name</code> local variable (let's assume <code>users_name = "Avi Flombaum"</code>). Finally, the program will print out the output of the <code>say_hello</code> method, which is <code>"Hi, Avi Flombaum!"</code>.</p>

<p>Now, go head and delete or comment out the code we just wrote. That was just for practice (and fun). Let's move on to the Jukebox.</p>

<p><img src="./:Users:jaspercurry:Development:code:jukebox-cli-001-prework-web_files/687474703a2f2f646c2e64726f70626f7875736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f732f6f7764666a69356c6a71756264686e2f323031342d30312d3239253230617425323031312e3130253230414d2e706e67" alt="Jukebox"></p>

<p>Your jukebox should respond to 4 commands: <code>help</code>, <code>play</code>, <code>list</code>, and <code>exit</code>.</p>

<p>When you run the program in the command line it should greet the user and prompt them for input. Your jukebox should respond to 4 commands: <code>help</code>, <code>play</code>, <code>list</code>, and <code>exit</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li>The help command should output instructions for the user on how to use the jukebox. </li>
<li>The list command should output a list of songs that the user can play. </li>
<li>The play command should ask a user to input a song name or number. It should then output 'Playing Phoenix - 1901' or whatever the song name is.</li>
<li>If the user types in exit, the jukebox should say goodbye and the program should shut down.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's take a closer look at the methods we'll need to build in order to get our Jukebox up and running as described here. </p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>We'll be building a series of methods that enact the desired behavior of our Jukebox. In <code>lib/jukebox.rb</code> we'll create a <code>help</code>, <code>play</code>, <code>list</code> and <code>exit_jukebox</code> method. Then, we'll build a <code>run</code> method that calls on all of these "helper" methods to implement the behavior of our program. The executable file in <code>bin/jukebox</code> file will simply call the <code>run</code> method that we define in <code>lib/jukebox.rb</code>. </p>

<p>Open up <code>lib/jukebox.rb</code> and you should see this:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0"><span class="n">songs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span></li><li class="L1">  <span class="s2">"Phoenix - 1901"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L2">  <span class="s2">"Tokyo Police Club - Wait Up"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L3">  <span class="s2">"Sufjan Stevens - Too Much"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L4">  <span class="s2">"The Naked and the Famous - Young Blood"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L5">  <span class="s2">"(Far From) Home - Tiga"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L6">  <span class="s2">"The Cults - Abducted"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L7">  <span class="s2">"Phoenix - Consolation Prizes"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L8">  <span class="s2">"Harry Chapin - Cats in the Cradle"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L9">  <span class="s2">"Amos Lee - Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight"</span></li><li class="L0"><span class="p">]</span></li></ol></code></pre>

<p>This is the list of songs that our jukebox will be working with. The methods we will write will operate on this arrays of songs. </p>

<h3>The <code>help</code> Method</h3>

<p>This method should <code>puts</code> out the following: </p>
<pre><code class="highlight shell prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0">I accept the following commands:</li><li class="L1">- <span class="nb">help</span> : displays this <span class="nb">help </span>message</li><li class="L2">- list : displays a list of songs you can play</li><li class="L3">- play : lets you choose a song to play</li><li class="L4">- <span class="nb">exit</span> : exits this program</li></ol></code></pre>

<h3>The <code>list</code> Method</h3>

<p>This method takes in an argument of the <code>songs</code> array of <code>puts</code> out the following:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight shell prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0">1. Phoenix - 1901</li><li class="L1">2. Tokyo Police Club - Wait Up</li><li class="L2">3. Sufjan Stevens - Too Much</li><li class="L3">4. The Naked and the Famous - Young Blood</li><li class="L4">5. <span class="o">(</span>Far From<span class="o">)</span> Home - Tiga</li><li class="L5">6. The Cults - Abducted</li><li class="L6">7. Phoenix - Consolation Prizes</li><li class="L7">8. Harry Chapin - Cats <span class="k">in </span>the Cradle</li><li class="L8">9. Amos Lee - Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight</li></ol></code></pre>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Use the <code>Array#each_with_index</code> method to access the index number of a given element as you step through the iteration. Remember that arrays are indexed starting at <code>0</code>. So, adding <code>1</code> to the index number at a given step of the iteration will result in the correct song number for the purposes of outputting your list of songs. </p>

<h3>The <code>play</code> Method</h3>

<p>This method also takes in an argument of the <code>songs</code> array. It first <code>puts</code> out the prompt: <code>"Please enter a song name or number:"</code>. It then stores the user's response using <code>gets.chomp</code>. </p>

<p>If the user's response is a valid song number or song name, the method should <code>puts</code> out: <code>"Playing &lt;song name&gt;"</code>. Otherwise, it should <code>puts</code> out: <code>"Invalid input, please try again"</code>. </p>

<h3>The <code>exit_jukebox</code> Method</h3>

<p>This method is simple. It <code>puts</code> out: <code>"Goodbye"</code>.</p>

<h3>The <code>run</code> Method</h3>

<p>This method is a little trickier. It will use the other methods we built, our "helper" methods, to actually enact the running of our Jukebox. </p>

<p>First, this method should call on the <code>help</code> method to show the user the available commands. Then, it should <code>puts</code> out the prompt: <code>"Please enter a command:"</code>. It should capture the user's response using <code>gets.chomp</code> or <code>gets.strip</code>. </p>

<p>We need to keep our program running as long as the user's input is <em>not</em> <code>"exit"</code>. Use a loop to continue asking the user for input until or unless their input is <code>"exit"</code>. Use <code>if</code> or <code>case</code> statements to determine how your program will respond to a user's input. For example, if their input is <code>"list"</code>, call the <code>list</code> method, if their input is <code>"play"</code>, call the <code>play</code> method, if their input is <code>"help"</code>, call the <code>help</code> method and if their input is <code>"exit"</code>, call the <code>exit_jukebox</code> method <em>and</em> break out of your loop to stop the program. </p>

<h2>Running Your Jukebox</h2>

<p>Packaged with this repository is a runner file <code>bin/jukebox</code>.</p>

<p>This executable file, <code>bin/jukebox</code>, is a Ruby file, but the ".rb" extension has been left off. The ".rb" extension is not mandatory for Ruby files, it is just a nice thing to have for the purposes of identifying the type of the file. However, it is a convention to leave the file extension off of executable files, which comes from true binary files that contain pure<br>
machine code (1's and 0's) rather than human readable source code like Ruby.</p>

<p>Open up <code>bin/jukebox</code> and you will see the following:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0"><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span></li><li class="L1">&nbsp;</li><li class="L2"><span class="n">require_relative</span> <span class="s2">"../lib/jukebox"</span></li><li class="L3">&nbsp;</li><li class="L4"><span class="n">songs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span></li><li class="L5">  <span class="s2">"Phoenix - 1901"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L6">  <span class="s2">"Tokyo Police Club - Wait Up"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L7">  <span class="s2">"Sufjan Stevens - Too Much"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L8">  <span class="s2">"The Naked and the Famous - Young Blood"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L9">  <span class="s2">"(Far From) Home - Tiga"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L0">  <span class="s2">"The Cults - Abducted"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L1">  <span class="s2">"Phoenix - Consolation Prizes"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L2">  <span class="s2">"Harry Chapin - Cats in the Cradle"</span><span class="p">,</span></li><li class="L3">  <span class="s2">"Amos Lee - Keep It Loose, Keep It Tight"</span></li><li class="L4"><span class="p">]</span></li><li class="L5">&nbsp;</li><li class="L6"><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">songs</span><span class="p">)</span></li></ol></code></pre>

<p>First, we require the <code>lib</code> file in which we defined our code. Now this executable file has access to all of the methods we defined in <code>lib/jukebox.rb</code>. Then we have our <code>songs</code> array. Then, we call <code>run(songs)</code>, the method we defined to enact the behavior of our program.</p>

<p>Assuming you are in the root directory of the jukebox project, run your jukebox from the command line with <code>ruby bin jukebox</code> or simply <code>bin/jukebox</code> (thanks to our shebang line).</p>

<h2>Testing Your Jukebox</h2>

<p>You already know that your Jukebox command line application relies on a user's input to run. In order to test our application programmatically––in other words, test it without having to run and interact with the program ourselves––we will rely on stubbing in our test suite. </p>

<h2>What is Stubbing?</h2>

<p>Stubbing refers to the fake implementation of a method. In the context of this test suite, we will stub the <code>gets</code> method call that our program relies on to obtain user input and feed it back into the application. In this way, we can simulate the CLI and effectively test our app. </p>

<p>Let's compare the regular running of our Jukebox––i.e., when a real live human interacts with it––with the testing of our Jukebox. We'll do this by taking a closer look at the <code>play</code> method. </p>

<p>Without giving away <em>all</em> of the implementation of this method and spoiling your fun, we can imagine that our <code>play</code> method might ask the user what song they want to hear, store that input using the <code>gets</code> method and use it to determine what song to play.  </p>

<p>Remember, the <code>gets</code> method lets the user input a line and returns that line to your program. In our test suite, we need to fake this interaction and we'll use stubbing to do it. Check out the following line from our <code>jukebox_spec.rb</code>:  </p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0"><span class="n">it</span> <span class="s2">"can use a full song name to find a song"</span> <span class="k">do</span></li><li class="L1">  <span class="n">allow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to</span> <span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:gets</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">and_return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Phoenix - 1901"</span><span class="p">)</span></li><li class="L2">  <span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">play</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">songs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">to</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/Phoenix - 1901/</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_stdout</span></li><li class="L3"><span class="k">end</span></li></ol></code></pre>

<p>Let's break down what's happening above: </p>

<p>With <code>allow(self).to receive(:gets).and_return("Phoenix - 1901")</code>,<br>
we are faking a call to the <code>gets</code> method and telling it to return a value of <code>"Phoenix - 1901"</code>. </p>

<p>Now, when we call the <code>play</code> method on the following line, it has a <code>gets</code> value to operate on. </p>

<p>Then, we test the output of the <code>play</code> method with<br>
 <code>expect{ play(songs) }.to output(/Phoenix - 1901/).to_stdout</code></p>

<p>This line uses one of Learn's output matchers. </p>

<h3>Output Matchers</h3>

<p>Learn's output matchers provide a way to check that your program has emitted output to <code>$stdout</code>––a global variable that keeps track of the current standard output to your terminal. Don't worry too much about global variables right now, just know that they can be accessed from anywhere in your program. </p>

<p>The <code>.to_stdout</code> method works by temporarily replacing the <code>$stdout</code> variable. When the <code>output</code> method is used with a string or a regex (as above), your test will pass if the block outputs a string <code>to_stdout</code> that matches the given string or regex.</p>

<p>So, these lines of our test suite:</p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0"><span class="n">allow</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to</span> <span class="n">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:gets</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">and_return</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Phoenix - 1901"</span><span class="p">)</span></li><li class="L1"><span class="n">expect</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">play</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">songs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}.</span><span class="nf">to</span> <span class="n">output</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/Phoenix - 1901/</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">to_stdout</span></li></ol></code></pre>

<p>Accomplish the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Establish a <code>gets</code> value for the <code>play</code> method to utilize</li>
<li>Execute the <code>play</code> method contained in the block </li>
<li>Check to see if the <code>play</code> method outputs content that matches the regular expression <code>/Phoenix - 1901/</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Advanced: Playing Music from Ruby</h2>

<p>In <code>lib/advanced_jukebox.rb</code> you'll be building on your jukebox so that it allows the user to play songs from the command line. You'll be playing the songs in <code>audio/Emerald-Park</code>, which contains some mp3 files. </p>

<h3>Setting Up the Songs Hash</h3>

<p>In <code>lib/advanced_jukebox.rb</code> you'll see a <code>my_songs</code> hash which has keys of song names and values of the path to of each mp3 file (in <code>jukebox-cli/audio/Emerald-Park/&lt;file name&gt;.mp3</code>). </p>

<p>Change the value of each hash key to reflect the correct file path. For example, if this jukebox-cli directory is in <code>Users/&lt;your name&gt;/Desktop/Dev/</code>, the value of the first key should be <code>Users/&lt;your name&gt;/Desktop/Dev/jukebox-cli/audio/Emerald-Park/01.mp3</code>. If you're not sure what the path to the file is, cd into the directory of this lab in your terminal and type <code>pwd</code>. This stands for "print working directory" and will return the path to your current location. </p>

<h3>How can a Ruby program play music?</h3>

<p>It is possible to play audio files via the command line by simply typing <code>open &lt;path to audio file&gt;</code>. This will launch your computer's audio player (iTunes, for example). In order to tell Ruby to execute a command line command, we use the following syntax: </p>
<pre><code class="highlight ruby prettyprint linenums nocode"><ol class="linenums"><li class="L0"><span class="nb">system</span> <span class="s1">'open &lt;path to audio file'</span></li></ol></code></pre>

<p>This is the code that you'll be adding to your <code>play</code> method in order to play the audio files we've provided for you. </p>

<h3>Coding <code>advanced_jukebox.rb</code></h3>

<p>Check out the code in <code>advanced_jukebox.rb</code>, we've left the method definitions for you and provided you the song hash, <code>my_songs</code>. </p>

<p>Follow the instructions in the comments of <code>advanced_jukebox.rb</code> to get your<br>
jukebox working. This is a bonus challenge, so there are no tests. Just get your jukebox playing music. </p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can open a file from the command line by typing <code>open &lt;filename&gt;</code> in your terminal. (If you are not using a Mac, the command you type will be a little <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6657777/open-text-file-and-program-shortcut-in-windows-batch-file" target="_blank">different</a>. If the file is an audio file, you computer will open the file and play it. We want our Ruby Jukebox program to execute that command for us. Ruby has method, <code>system</code>, that is called with an argument of a string that contains the command line command you want to execute. When Ruby invokes that method, the command you placed in the string will be executed. So, to play a song from a Ruby file, you can use <code>system "open #{filename}"</code>. </p>

<p><strong>Run your advanced jukebox program by typing <code>ruby bin/advanced_jukebox</code> in your terminal. This is the runner file for the <code>advanced_jukebox.rb</code> code.</strong></p>
